# Embedded Biometric Analysis: Real-Time Heart Rate Monitoring (Arduino Project)

## Project Summary

This project, completed during undergraduate studies, focused on the intersection of embedded systems and biomedical data analysis. It involved creating a physical monitoring system using an Arduino microcontroller interfaced with a heart rate sensor (pulse sensor), capturing real-time physiological data, and performing subsequent analysis to derive meaningful health insights.

## Core Objectives & Applications 

This work demonstrates foundational skills in both hardware integration and data-driven analysis:

* Real-Time Data Acquisition: Demonstrated the ability to successfully interface hardware components (sensors) with a microcontroller (Arduino) to capture clean, consistent physiological data streams.

* Biometric Signal Processing: Applied basic analysis techniques (filtering, time-series analysis) to raw pulse sensor data to accurately calculate and stabilize heart rate (BPM).

* Hardware-Software Integration: Proved competence in developing firmware (C/C++) for embedded systems and piping data to a desktop environment for persistent analysis and visualization.

## Technical Scope & Components 

The project required proficiency across hardware, firmware, and desktop analysis environments:

* Hardware: Arduino (e.g., Uno or Nano), Pulse Sensor/Heart Rate Monitor.

* Firmware: C/C++ (Arduino IDE) for sensor reading, signal conditioning, and serial data transmission.

* Data Analysis: Python (or similar) used for post-processing the serial output, smoothing data, and visualizing trends over time.

* Key Metrics Derived: Beats Per Minute (BPM), Heart Rate Variability (HRV - simplified metrics).

## Key Professional Learnings 

* Embedded Systems Development: Gained hands-on experience in the full lifecycle of a basic embedded system, from schematic setup to code deployment.

* Data Integrity in IoT: Focus on ensuring the reliability and accuracy of data captured from physical sensors, a critical skill in the Internet of Things (IoT) space.

* Interdisciplinary Problem Solving: Successfully integrated electrical engineering concepts (sensor reading) with computer science (data processing) to solve a practical monitoring problem.
