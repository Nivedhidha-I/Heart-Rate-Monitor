# Embedded Biometric Analysis: Real-Time Heart Rate Monitoring (Arduino Project)

## Project Summary

This project, completed during undergraduate studies, focused on the intersection of embedded systems and biomedical data analysis. It involved creating a physical monitoring system using an Arduino microcontroller interfaced with a heart rate sensor (pulse sensor), capturing real-time physiological data, and performing subsequent analysis to derive meaningful health insights.

## Core Objectives & Applications 

This work demonstrates foundational skills in both hardware integration and data-driven analysis:

* Real-Time Data Acquisition: Demonstrated the ability to successfully interface hardware components (sensors) with a microcontroller (Arduino) to capture clean, consistent physiological data streams.

* Biometric Signal Processing: Applied basic analysis techniques (filtering, time-series analysis) to raw pulse sensor data to accurately calculate and stabilize heart rate (BPM).

* Hardware-Software Integration: Proved competence in developing firmware (C/C++) for embedded systems and piping data to a desktop environment for persistent analysis and visualization.

## Technical Scope & Components 

The project required proficiency across hardware, firmware, and desktop analysis environments:

* Hardware: Arduino Uno, Heart Rate Sensor.

* Firmware: C/C++ (Arduino IDE) for sensor reading, signal conditioning, and serial data transmission.
